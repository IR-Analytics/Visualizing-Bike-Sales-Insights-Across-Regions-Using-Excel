📊 Visualizing Bike Sales Insights Across Regions Using Excel

Hi there! This project dives into bike purchase behavior across Europe, North America, and the Pacific. Using Excel, I started with raw customer data and ended up with an interactive dashboard that helps uncover what drives people to buy bikes.

From income and age to commute distance and region, I explored how different factors affect purchasing decisions — all with PivotTables and some clean visuals.

🧼 What I Did

Cleaned up the raw data by formatting incomes, fixing categories (like Gender and Marital Status), and making sure everything was ready for analysis.

Used PivotTables to summarize key metrics like average income, distance, and age of buyers.

Built an interactive dashboard with slicers so you can filter by Marital Status, Education, and Region.

Focused on keeping things simple and clean so anyone can make sense of the data.


💡 Insights from the Dashboard

Which gender tends to spend more on bikes?

Does having a long commute mean you're more likely to buy a bike?

What age group is most into biking?

How does region influence buying behavior?

You can explore all these by playing with the slicers on the dashboard!

🎯 Why It Matters

This project shows how Excel can do more than just tables and formulas — it can tell stories. Even with basic tools, you can turn raw data into useful, actionable insights. Whether it's for marketing, sales, or general customer analysis, Excel gets the job done.
